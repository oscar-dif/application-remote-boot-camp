    <p>
      Pair programming is a technique where two programmers work together at the same work station.<br>
      It is an agile method which consists of an author and an observer.
      The author writes the code and the observer checks the code for errors.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the progress, the observer will not just check the code for errors but also do a continuous strategic evaluation of the work.<br>
      In that way the team can avoid future obstacles.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the method is well used, it is not without risks.<br>
      It is important that the roles are clear and that the level of competence and engagement are close to each other.<br>
      Otherwise it might affect both the team work and the result.
